# Osteoporosis Prediction using Deep Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting osteoporosis from knee X-ray images using various deep learning models. The goal is to classify images into 'Healthy' and 'Osteoporosis' categories to aid in early diagnosis and treatment planning.

## Models and Performance

The following models were used for classification:

- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: 93.2% Accuracy
- **VGG19**: 94.3% Accuracy
- **AlexNet**: 78% Accuracy
- **ResNet**: 94.8% Accuracy
- **GoogLeNet**: 78% Accuracy
- **DenseNet**: 89% Accuracy

## Dataset

The dataset consists of knee X-ray images categorized into 'Healthy' and 'Osteoporosis' classes. It is sourced from Kaggle and includes a range of images for training and testing the models.

## Code and Implementation

The models were implemented using TensorFlow/Keras. You can explore the code and details of the models on my Kaggle profile:
